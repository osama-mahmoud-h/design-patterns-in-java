# Design Patterns in Java

This repository provides examples and explanations of common design patterns implemented in Java.

## What are Design Patterns?

Design patterns are reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like blueprints that you can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code.

## Why Use Design Patterns?

* **Improved Code Readability:** Design patterns make your code easier to understand and maintain by providing a standard way to solve common problems.
* **Increased Code Reusability:** Design patterns are reusable solutions that can be applied to different parts of your application or even different projects.
* **Reduced Code Complexity:** Design patterns help to break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts.
* **Enhanced Flexibility:** Design patterns can make your code more flexible and adaptable to change.

## Categories of Design Patterns

Design patterns are often categorized into three main types:

* **Creational Patterns:** These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. Examples include Singleton, Factory Method, and Abstract Factory.
* **Structural Patterns:** These patterns deal with composing classes and objects to form larger structures and provide new functionality. Examples include Adapter, Decorator, and Facade.
* **Behavioral Patterns:** These patterns deal with the assignment of responsibilities between objects and how they communicate. Examples include Observer, Strategy, and Template Method.

## Design Patterns Covered in this Repository

This repository currently includes examples of the following design patterns:

**Creational Patterns**

* **Singleton:** Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
* **Factory Method:** Defines an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
* **Abstract Factory:** Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
* **Builder:** Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.
**Structural Patterns**

* **Adapter:** Converts the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.
* **Decorator:** Dynamically adds responsibilities to an object.
* **Facade:** Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
* **composite:** Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
* **Proxy:** Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

**Behavioral Patterns**

* **Observer:** Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
* **Command:** Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with different requests, queuing of requests, and logging of requests.
* **Strategy:** Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each algorithm, and makes the algorithms interchangeable within the family.
